                   language models has achieved encouraging results on complex
                   reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose a new decoding
                   strategy, self-consistency, to replace the naive greedy
                   decoding used in chain-of-thought prompting. It first samples
                   a diverse set of reasoning paths instead of only taking the
                   greedy one, and then selects the most consistent answer by
                   marginalizing out the sampled reasoning paths.
                   Self-consistency leverages the intuition that a complex
                   reasoning problem typically admits multiple different ways of
                   thinking leading to its unique correct answer. Our extensive
                   empirical evaluation shows that self-consistency boosts the
                   performance of chain-of-thought prompting with a striking
                   margin on a range of popular arithmetic and commonsense

                   focus on scaling language models whilst keeping the amount of
                   training data constant. By training over 400 language models
                   ranging from 70 million to over 16 billion parameters on 5 to
                   500 billion tokens, we find that for compute-optimal
                   training, the model size and the number of training tokens

                   the number of training tokens should also be doubled. We test
                   this hypothesis by training a predicted compute-optimal

                   LLMs by using tree-search algorithms to guide multi-step
                   reasoning. These methods rely on prompting a pre-trained
                   model to serve as a value function and focus on problems with
                   low search depth. As a result, these methods will not work in
                   domains where the pre-trained LLM does not have enough
                   knowledge to serve as an effective value function or in
                   domains that require long-horizon planning. To address these

                   Math-Shepherd in two scenarios: 1) \textit{Verification}:
                   Math-Shepherd is utilized for reranking multiple outputs
                   generated by Large Language Models (LLMs); 2)

                   reinforce LLMs with step-by-step Proximal Policy Optimization
                   (PPO). With Math-Shepherd, a series of open-source LLMs

               moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses
               'value networks' to evaluate board positions and 'policy
               networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained
               by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert
               games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play.

                   observe that coverage - the fraction of problems solved by
                   any attempt - scales with the number of samples over four
                   orders of magnitude. In domains like coding and formal
                   proofs, where all answers can be automatically verified,
                   these increases in coverage directly translate into improved
                   performance. When we apply repeated sampling to SWE-bench
                   Lite, the fraction of issues solved with
                   DeepSeek-V2-Coder-Instruct increases from 15.9\% with one
                   sample to 56\% with 250 samples, outperforming the
                   single-attempt state-of-the-art of 43\% which uses more
                   capable frontier models. Moreover, using current API pricing,
                   amplifying the cheaper DeepSeek model with five samples is
                   more cost-effective and solves more issues than paying a
                   premium for one sample from GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
                   Interestingly, the relationship between coverage and the
                   number of samples is often log-linear and can be modelled
                   with an exponentiated power law, suggesting the existence of
                   inference-time scaling laws. Finally, we find that
                   identifying correct samples out of many generations remains
                   an important direction for future research in domains without
                   automatic verifiers. When solving math word problems from
                   GSM8K and MATH, coverage with Llama-3 models grows to over
                   95\% with 10,000 samples. However, common methods to pick
                   correct solutions from a sample collection, such as majority
                   voting or reward models, plateau beyond several hundred
                   samples and fail to fully scale with the sample budget.",

                   been given to the benefits of scaling compute during
                   inference. This survey focuses on these inference-time

                   mathematical formalism: token-level generation algorithms,
                   meta-generation algorithms, and efficient generation.
                   Token-level generation algorithms, often called decoding
                   algorithms, operate by sampling a single token at a time or
                   constructing a token-level search space and then selecting an
                   output. These methods typically assume access to a language
                   model's logits, next-token distributions, or probability
                   scores. Meta-generation algorithms work on partial or full
                   sequences, incorporating domain knowledge, enabling
                   backtracking, and integrating external information. Efficient

                   training. They then struggle to look beyond the next token,
                   suffering from a snowballing of errors and struggling to
                   predict the consequence of their actions several steps ahead.
                   In this paper, we show how language models can be taught to
                   search by representing the process of search in language, as
                   a flattened string -- a stream of search (SoS). We propose a
                   unified language for search that captures an array of
                   different symbolic search strategies. We demonstrate our
                   approach using the simple yet difficult game of Countdown,
                   where the goal is to combine input numbers with arithmetic
                   operations to reach a target number. We pretrain a
                   transformer-based language model from scratch on a dataset of
                   streams of search generated by heuristic solvers. We find
                   that SoS pretraining increases search accuracy by 25\% over
                   models trained to predict only the optimal search trajectory.
                   We further finetune this model with two policy improvement
                   methods: Advantage-Induced Policy Alignment (APA) and
                   Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR). The finetuned SoS models solve
                   36\% of previously unsolved problems, including problems that
                   cannot be solved by any of the heuristic solvers. Our results
                   indicate that language models can learn to solve problems via
                   search, self-improve to flexibly use different search

                   Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning
                   as a method of answering questions or completing agentic
                   tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For
                   example, this applies to the steps not stated between the
                   lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a
                   conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et
                   al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales
                   from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning
                   from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly
                   constrained setting -- ideally, a language model could
                   instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text.
                   We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs
                   learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future
                   text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges,
                   including 1) the computational cost of generating
                   continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially
                   know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the
                   need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve
                   these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm,
                   using learnable tokens indicating a thought's start and end,
                   and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly,
                   generated rationales disproportionately help model
                   difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM's ability to
                   directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after
                   continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text
                   with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K
                   (5.9\%$\rightarrow$10.9\%) and CommonsenseQA
                   (36.3\%$\rightarrow$47.2\%) and observe a perplexity
                   improvement of difficult tokens in natural text. Crucially,
                   these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks.
                   Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason
                   in a more general and scalable way.",

                   However, inducing language model rationale generation
                   currently requires either constructing massive rationale
                   datasets or sacrificing accuracy by using only few-shot
                   inference. We propose a technique to iteratively leverage a

                   without rationales, to bootstrap the ability to perform
                   successively more complex reasoning. This technique, the
                   ``Self-Taught Reasoner'' (STaR), relies on a simple loop:
                   generate rationales to answer many questions, prompted with a
                   few rationale examples; if the generated answers are wrong,
                   try again to generate a rationale given the correct answer;
                   fine-tune on all the rationales that ultimately yielded
                   correct answers; repeat. We show that STaR significantly
                   improves performance on multiple datasets compared to a model
                   fine-tuned to directly predict final answers, and performs
                   comparably to fine-tuning a 30$\times$ larger
                   state-of-the-art language model on CommensenseQA. Thus, STaR

                   we should supervise such models: outcome-based approaches
                   which supervise the final result, or process-based approaches
                   which supervise the reasoning process itself? Differences
                   between these approaches might naturally be expected not just
                   in final-answer errors but also in reasoning errors, which
                   can be difficult to detect and are problematic in many
                   real-world domains such as education. We run the first
                   comprehensive comparison between process- and outcome-based
                   approaches trained on a natural language task, GSM8K. We find
                   that pure outcome-based supervision produces similar
                   final-answer error rates with less label supervision.
                   However, for correct reasoning steps we find it necessary to
                   use process-based supervision or supervision from learned
                   reward models that emulate process-based feedback. In total,
                   we improve the previous best results from 16.8\% $\to$ 12.7\%
                   final-answer error and 14.0\% $\to$ 3.4\% reasoning error
                   among final-answer-correct solutions.",

                   language models (LLMs), yet it has consistently been found to
                   be largely ineffective in modern LLMs. Current methods for
                   training self-correction typically depend on either multiple
                   models, a more advanced model, or additional forms of
                   supervision. To address these shortcomings, we develop a
                   multi-turn online reinforcement learning (RL) approach,
                   SCoRe, that significantly improves an LLM's self-correction
                   ability using entirely self-generated data. To build SCoRe,
                   we first show that variants of supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
                   on offline model-generated correction traces are often
                   insufficient for instilling self-correction behavior. In
                   particular, we observe that training via SFT falls prey to
                   either a distribution mismatch between mistakes made by the
                   data-collection policy and the model's own responses, or to
                   behavior collapse, where learning implicitly prefers only a
                   certain mode of correction behavior that is often not
                   effective at self-correction on test problems. SCoRe
                   addresses these challenges by training under the model's own
                   distribution of self-generated correction traces and using
                   appropriate regularization to steer the learning process into
                   learning a self-correction behavior that is effective at test
                   time as opposed to fitting high-reward responses for a given
                   prompt. This regularization process includes an initial phase
                   of multi-turn RL on a base model to generate a policy
                   initialization that is less susceptible to collapse, followed
                   by using a reward bonus to amplify self-correction. With
                   Gemini 1.0 Pro and 1.5 Flash models, we find that SCoRe
                   achieves state-of-the-art self-correction performance,

                   is clear and easy to check -- a property we call legibility.
                   We study legibility in the context of solving grade-school
                   math problems and show that optimizing chain-of-thought
                   solutions only for answer correctness can make them less
                   legible. To mitigate the loss in legibility, we propose a
                   training algorithm inspired by Prover-Verifier Game from Anil
                   et al. (2021). Our algorithm iteratively trains small
                   verifiers to predict solution correctness, ``helpful''
                   provers to produce correct solutions that the verifier
                   accepts, and ``sneaky'' provers to produce incorrect
                   solutions that fool the verifier. We find that the helpful
                   prover's accuracy and the verifier's robustness to
                   adversarial attacks increase over the course of training.
                   Furthermore, we show that legibility training transfers to
                   time-constrained humans tasked with verifying solution
                   correctness. Over course of LLM training human accuracy
                   increases when checking the helpful prover's solutions, and
                   decreases when checking the sneaky prover's solutions. Hence,
                   training for checkability by small verifiers is a plausible

                   logical mistakes. To train more reliable models, we can turn
                   either to outcome supervision, which provides feedback for a

                   open-ended natural language. In this paper, we study the
                   scaling of inference-time computation in LLMs, with a focus
                   on answering the question: if an LLM is allowed to use a
                   fixed but non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how
                   much can it improve its performance on a challenging prompt?
                   Answering this question has implications not only on the
                   achievable performance of LLMs, but also on the future of LLM
                   pretraining and how one should tradeoff inference-time and
                   pre-training compute. Despite its importance, little research
                   attempted to understand the scaling behaviors of various
                   test-time inference methods. Moreover, current work largely
                   provides negative results for a number of these strategies.
                   In this work, we analyze two primary mechanisms to scale
                   test-time computation: (1) searching against dense,
                   process-based verifier reward models; and (2) updating the
                   model's distribution over a response adaptively, given the
                   prompt at test time. We find that in both cases, the
                   effectiveness of different approaches to scaling test-time
                   compute critically varies depending on the difficulty of the
                   prompt. This observation motivates applying a
                   ``compute-optimal'' scaling strategy, which acts to most
                   effectively allocate test-time compute adaptively per prompt.
                   Using this compute-optimal strategy, we can improve the
                   efficiency of test-time compute scaling by more than 4x
                   compared to a best-of-N baseline. Additionally, in a
                   FLOPs-matched evaluation, we find that on problems where a
                   smaller base model attains somewhat non-trivial success
                   rates, test-time compute can be used to outperform a 14x

                   by growing batch reinforcement learning (RL), which we call
                   Reinforced Self-Training (ReST). Given an initial LLM policy,
                   ReST produces a dataset by generating samples from the
                   policy, which are then used to improve the LLM policy using

                   systems: the fast and intuitive System 1 and the slower but
                   more deliberative System 2. Recent studies have shown that
                   incorporating System 2 process into Transformers including
                   large language models (LLMs), significantly enhances their
                   reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, models that purely
                   resemble System 2 thinking require substantially higher
                   computational costs and are much slower to respond. To
                   address this challenge, we present Dualformer, a single
                   Transformer model that seamlessly integrates both the fast
                   and slow reasoning modes. Dualformer is obtained by training
                   on data with randomized reasoning traces, where different
                   parts of the traces are dropped during training. The dropping
                   strategies are specifically tailored according to the trace
                   structure, analogous to analyzing our thinking process and
                   creating shortcuts with patterns. At inference time, our
                   model can be configured to output only the solutions (fast

                   (slow mode), or automatically decide which mode to engage

                   corresponding baseline models in both performance and
                   computational efficiency: (1) in slow mode, Dualformer
                   optimally solves unseen 30 x 30 maze navigation tasks 97.6\%
                   of the time, surpassing the Searchformer (trained on data
                   with complete reasoning traces) baseline performance of
                   93.3\%, while only using 45.5\% fewer reasoning steps; (2) in
                   fast mode, Dualformer completes those tasks with an 80\%
                   optimal rate, significantly outperforming the Solution-Only
                   model (trained on solution-only data), which has an optimal
                   rate of only 30\%. For math problems, our techniques have

                   trace, potentially improving credit assignment over outcome
                   reward models (ORMs) that only provide feedback at the final
                   step. However, collecting dense, per-step human labels is not
                   scalable, and training PRMs from automatically-labeled data
                   has thus far led to limited gains. To improve a base policy
                   by running search against a PRM or using it as dense rewards
                   for reinforcement learning (RL), we ask: ``How should we
                   design process rewards?''. Our key insight is that, to be
                   effective, the process reward for a step should measure
                   progress: a change in the likelihood of producing a correct
                   response in the future, before and after taking the step,
                   corresponding to the notion of step-level advantages in RL.
                   Crucially, this progress should be measured under a prover
                   policy distinct from the base policy. We theoretically
                   characterize the set of good provers and our results show
                   that optimizing process rewards from such provers improves
                   exploration during test-time search and online RL. In fact,
                   our characterization shows that weak prover policies can
                   substantially improve a stronger base policy, which we also
                   observe empirically. We validate our claims by training
                   process advantage verifiers (PAVs) to predict progress under
                   such provers, and show that compared to ORMs, test-time
                   search against PAVs is $>8\%$ more accurate, and
                   $1.5-5\times$ more compute-efficient. Online RL with dense
                   rewards from PAVs enables one of the first results with

                   methods demand discriminators with at least 90\% accuracy to
                   achieve significant improvements over re-ranking; (2) current

                   demonstrated impressive performance in Large Language Model
                   (LLM) reasoning. However, the growth of the reasoning chain
                   introduces uncertainty and error accumulation, making it
                   challenging to elicit accurate final results. To tackle this
                   challenge of uncertainty in multi-step reasoning, we
                   introduce a stepwise self-evaluation mechanism to guide and
                   calibrate the reasoning process of LLMs. We propose a
                   decoding algorithm integrating the self-evaluation guidance
                   via stochastic beam search. The self-evaluation guidance
                   serves as a better-calibrated automatic criterion,
                   facilitating an efficient search in the reasoning space and
                   resulting in superior prediction quality. Stochastic beam
                   search balances exploitation and exploration of the search
                   space with temperature-controlled randomness. Our approach

                   unnormalized target distribution defined by a given reward or
                   potential function over the full sequence. In this work, we
                   leverage the rich toolkit of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) for
                   these probabilistic inference problems. In particular, we use

                   reasoning, yet their application in agentic, multi-step
                   reasoning within interactive environments remains a difficult
                   challenge. Traditional supervised pre-training on static
                   datasets falls short in enabling autonomous agent
                   capabilities needed to perform complex decision-making in
                   dynamic settings like web navigation. Previous attempts to
                   bridge this ga-through supervised fine-tuning on curated
                   expert demonstrations-often suffer from compounding errors
                   and limited exploration data, resulting in sub-optimal policy
                   outcomes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
                   framework that combines guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
                   search with a self-critique mechanism and iterative
                   fine-tuning on agent interactions using an off-policy variant
                   of the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm. Our
                   method allows LLM agents to learn effectively from both
                   successful and unsuccessful trajectories, thereby improving
                   their generalization in complex, multi-step reasoning tasks.
                   We validate our approach in the WebShop environment-a
                   simulated e-commerce platform where it consistently
                   outperforms behavior cloning and reinforced fine-tuning

                   with the capability to do online search. In real-world
                   booking scenarios, our methodology boosts Llama-3 70B model's
                   zero-shot performance from 18.6\% to 81.7\% success rate (a

               (CoT) reasoning improves performance on complex problem-solving
               tasks. Further, several popular approaches exist to
               ``self-improve`` the abilities of LLMs to use CoT on tasks where
               supervised (question, answer) datasets are available. However, an
               emerging line of work explores whether self-improvement is
               possible without supervised datasets, instead utilizing the same
               large, general-purpose text corpora as used during pre-training.
               These pre-training datasets encompass large parts of human
               knowledge and dwarf all finetuning datasets in size.
               Self-improving CoT abilities on such general datasets could
               enhance reasoning for any general-purpose text generation task,
               and doing so at pre-training scale may unlock unprecedented
               reasoning abilities. In this paper, we outline the path towards
               self-improving CoT reasoning at pre-training scale and address
               fundamental challenges in this direction. We start by framing
               this as a reinforcement learning problem: given the first $n$
               tokens from a large pre-training corpus, the model generates a
               CoT and receives a reward based on how well the CoT helps predict
               the following $m$ tokens. We then investigate a fundamental
               question: What constitutes a suitable reward function for
               learning to reason during general language modelling? We outline
               the desirable qualities of such a reward function and empirically
               demonstrate how different functions affect what reasoning is
               learnt and where reasoning is rewarded. Using these insights, we
               introduce a novel reward function called Reasoning Advantage (RA)
               that facilitates self-improving CoT reasoning on free-form
               question-answering (QA) data, where answers are unstructured and
               difficult to verify. Equipped with a suitable reward function, we
               explore the optimization of it on general-purpose text using
               offline RL. Our analysis indicates that future work should
               investigate more powerful optimisation algorithms, potentially
               moving towards more online algorithms that better explore the
               space of CoT generations.",
